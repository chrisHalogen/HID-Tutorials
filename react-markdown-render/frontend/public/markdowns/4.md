You want a **Bash script** to **backup** your `Documents` folder.

Hereâ€™s a simple but solid script for you:

---

### `backup_documents.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# === CONFIGURATION ===
SOURCE_DIR="$HOME/Documents"
BACKUP_DIR="$HOME/Backups"
DATE=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S")
BACKUP_NAME="documents_backup_$DATE.tar.gz"

# === CREATE BACKUP DIRECTORY IF IT DOESN'T EXIST ===
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# === CREATE BACKUP ===
tar -czvf "$BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_NAME" "$SOURCE_DIR"

# === DONE ===
echo "Backup completed successfully!"
echo "Backup saved as: $BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_NAME"
```

---

### ðŸ›  How it works:

- **SOURCE_DIR**: The folder you want to back up (`~/Documents`).
- **BACKUP_DIR**: Where to save the backup (here it's `~/Backups`).
- It creates a **timestamped** compressed `.tar.gz` file like:  
  `documents_backup_2025-04-28_13-45-12.tar.gz`
- If `Backups` directory doesn't exist, it **creates it automatically**.
- **tar** + **gzip** are used to compress.

---

### ðŸš€ How to use it:

1. Save the script above into a file, for example: `backup_documents.sh`.
2. Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x backup_documents.sh
```

3. Run it:

```bash
./backup_documents.sh
```

A compressed backup will be created inside your `~/Backups/` directory.

---

### ðŸ§  Extra: Want it even _cooler_?

You could:

- Automatically **delete old backups** after X days.
- Send a **notification** after backup.
- Run it automatically using a **cron job**.

Example to delete backups older than 7 days:

```bash
find "$BACKUP_DIR" -type f -name "*.tar.gz" -mtime +7 -exec rm {} \;
```

(Add that line at the bottom of the script if you want.)
