Here's a **clear comparison** of **REST** vs **GraphQL** in **table format**:

| Feature                            | REST                                                  | GraphQL                                                             |
| :--------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Data Fetching**                  | Multiple endpoints for different resources            | Single endpoint for all data queries                                |
| **Over-fetching / Under-fetching** | Common issue (fetch too much or too little data)      | Client requests exactly what it needs (no more, no less)            |
| **Versioning**                     | Often uses URL versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/`)          | Typically versionless; evolve schema over time                      |
| **Request Type**                   | HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)                 | Always POST (typically) with queries and mutations inside           |
| **Flexibility**                    | Less flexible (fixed server-defined responses)        | Highly flexible (client defines structure of response)              |
| **Learning Curve**                 | Easier for beginners                                  | Steeper for beginners (requires understanding schemas)              |
| **Performance**                    | Can be slower (especially with multiple roundtrips)   | Can be faster (single request can fetch everything needed)          |
| **Tooling**                        | Mature tools like Postman, Swagger                    | Modern tools like GraphiQL, Apollo Studio                           |
| **Error Handling**                 | Based on HTTP status codes                            | Custom error object in the response payload                         |
| **File Uploads**                   | Straightforward with multipart/form-data              | More complex (needs special handling, e.g., Apollo Upload)          |
| **Caching**                        | Easier (uses HTTP caching and proxies)                | Harder (requires client-side caching strategies like Apollo Client) |
| **Real-time Updates**              | Requires additional setup (WebSockets, polling, etc.) | Built-in support via subscriptions                                  |
| **Type System**                    | No enforced type system                               | Strongly typed via schema                                           |
| **Development Speed**              | Slower changes (server needs updating for new data)   | Faster iteration (clients can request new fields immediately)       |
| **Typical Use Cases**              | Simple CRUD apps, traditional APIs                    | Complex apps, dynamic UIs (e.g., dashboards, mobile apps)           |

âœ… **In short**:

- Use **REST** if you want **simplicity** and **standard web conventions**.
- Use **GraphQL** if you need **flexibility**, **complex querying**, or **real-time features**.
