# Deploying a React App to GitHub Pages

This guide explains how to deploy a React application to GitHub Pages using `gh-pages`.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have:
- A GitHub account
- Node.js and npm installed on your computer
- A React project ready for deployment

---

## 1. Create an Empty Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create a new repository named **deploy-react-git**.
2. Do **not** initialize with a README, `.gitignore`, or license.

---

## 2. Clone the Empty Repository
Use an access token (recommended) or SSH to clone your new repository:
```sh
 git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/deploy-react-git.git
```

Navigate into the cloned repo:
```sh
 cd deploy-react-git
```

Copy your React project files into this directory.

---

## 3. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all dependencies:
```sh
 npm install
```
The only non-default packages used in this project are:
- `sass` (for SCSS styling)
- `axios` (for HTTP requests)

If not installed, install them manually:
```sh
 npm install sass axios
```

---

## 4. Install GitHub Pages Package
Install `gh-pages` as a development dependency:
```sh
 npm install gh-pages --save-dev
```

---

## 5. Update `package.json`

### Add the `homepage` field
Inside `package.json`, add the following line:
```json
"homepage": "https://<your-github-username>.github.io/deploy-react-git",
```

### Add Deployment Scripts
Update the `scripts` section in `package.json`:
```json
"scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
}
```

---

## 6. Push Project to GitHub
Run the following commands to push your project to GitHub:
```sh
 git init
 git add .
 git commit -m "First commit"
 git branch -M main
 git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-github-username>/deploy-react-git.git
 git push -u origin main
```

---

## 7. Deploy to GitHub Pages
Run the following command:
```sh
 npm run deploy
```
This will:
- Create a `gh-pages` branch.
- Build and deploy your project to GitHub Pages.

---

## 8. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to **Repository Settings > Pages**
2. Under **Branch**, select `gh-pages`
3. Click **Save**
4. After a few minutes, your site will be live at:
```
https://<your-github-username>.github.io/deploy-react-git/
```

---

## 9. (Optional) Automate Deployments
Each time you make changes, update your repository and redeploy:
```sh
 git add .
 git commit -m "Updated project"
 git push origin main
 npm run deploy
```
This ensures your site stays up to date with your latest changes.

## ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations!
Your React app is now hosted on GitHub Pages! ðŸš€
